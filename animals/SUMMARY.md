This Java program is a basic repository of animal behaviours. 
To demonstrate the use of interfaces I use the selection of the user to drive the display of behavioural information for a particular animal.

The requirements of this program were as follows:

- Implement at least four classes (showing inheritance) with suitable constructors and methods to set/retrieve values of/from the properties.
- Try to catch all specific exceptions instead of catching them through the parent Exception class. You can also implement your own exception-handling classes as well.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using JFrame to insert, update and view information for at least one of the classes you have created.
- The instances of user-defined classes must be saved in a user-defined data structure supported by Java, or you can implement your own data structure.
