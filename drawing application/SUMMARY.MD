This program is a drawing application, allowing a user to select and draw with the mouse input, selecting shapes and colours as desired.

The requirements of the program were as follows:

- Design a drawing application (have a look at Microsoft Paint application on your Windows system or Paintbrush on the Mac). The application must have menus and allow the user to draw different shapes. See the figure of shapes taken from Chapter 10 of Deitel and Deitel (2014). You can implement this or a similar hierarchy and extend it by adding other shapes like circles, arcs, etc.
- You should try to make use of all the GUI components learned throughout this Module to make your interface look as natural as possible. The interface should provide the following functionalities at a minimum:
- The user is able to select a colour of an object outline.
- The user is able to select a colour to be filled into an object.
- The user is able to select an object to draw. The object should be drawn in a continuous motion of the mouse; dragging will set the size of the shape. For instance, when the user presses a button, the program captures the first coordinate, and on the release of mouse, the shape is drawn on the interface. While the user is moving the mouse when the button is already down, the interface should show the updated shape.
